# blog_data
In this repo I store all my python files that are eventually uploaded to my [blog][1]. Also included is the data produced from my blog. Working on this repo provides me with experience working on github and collaborating with my friend, CJ. As of now I only have one project in the repo, my NBA draft analysis project. 

## NBA draft analysis
My first project that is being uploaded here to github and to my blog is an analysis of the NBA draft. While many people have previously analyzed the correlation between draft position and player quality, my hope is to (1) recreate some of this analysis to learn more about Python and (2) to do some analysis on how well GMs/coaches have done at drafting since the NBA merger in 1976. To put it lightly, lots of NBA draft analysis has been done ([ex1][3], [ex2][4]), including a [study][2] by ESPN looking at the second question of the best GM drafters. Despite not being original analysis, I'm choosing to start here because  this previous analysis provides a solid backdrop to check my results against as well as to potentially expand upon. 

### Files
My NBA draft analysis files are broken into parts as I work through gathering, cleaning, and analyzing the data. For this I have been using Jupyter notebooks and I plug in lots of commentary to explain my process. I have not been uploading clean files because I want to show on my blog (and here) my learning process to hopefully help others as well as to track my development in writing cleaner, more efficient code and doing so faster. 
I also have a folder, NBA_Data, that contains all the CSV's I create during the project. 

## Future projects
Once I finish the NBA draft analysis project I will be starting another project, hopefully with a larger data set. What these later projects will be, I am not sure. I'd like to work on projects of more significance than sports, but sports offers a lot of data and I find it very interesting to assess. I also plan to work through Kaggle competition projects and upload those project files here.
