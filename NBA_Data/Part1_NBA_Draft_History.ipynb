    "# What's this about?\n",
    "For the next few blog posts I'll be dealing with NBA draft data. If you pay attention to the NBA at all, then you'll be aware of what the draft is and it's presumed importance. Basketball analysts such as Zach Lowe and Bill Simmons have  argued that the best chance a bad team has at being a good team is to have a high draft pick, while many empirical studies show the value of draft position: [here][3], [here] [2], and [here] [1] and general managers have staked their careers on the premise that the way to a great team was through drafting a star player. Given the importance of the draft then, I decided to take a look at the link between draft position and player quality (pretty well established correlation) as well as looking at whether certain GM's or coaches consistently beat the odds in the draft. \n",
    "Since teams have equivalent information on the players they are going to draft, there should be a clear link between the quality of the player and the player's draft position. GM's and coaches that consistently get good players from lower draft positions then either are evaulating the available information differently or better at developing players. Teasing these two apart may not be possible, but given that Sam Hinkie based his career on having high draft picks, I think it's worth looking at whether there are GM's or coaches that are able to grab players that exceed the average player's performance given the same draft position. This analysis has actually been done [before][4] (and [again][5]) so my analysis will be extending this to more years as well as looking to pull apart the influence of the coach as compared to the GM in drafting performance. Another advantage of this project, despite being done before, is that I have something to compare my results too (granted I'll need to find access to these projects) and to look to for ideas on how to actually analyze the data.\n",
    "# What does this project teach me?\n",
    "To complete this project, I'll need to scrape data from a number of websites, convert them into Pandas DataFrames and merge them. Most of this project will be gathering and cleaning data, but eventually I will be graphing player performance based against draft position and analyzing which GM's and coaches did better in the draft.\n",

    "This project will be carried out in parts and I will be trying to share how I did things as well as the difficulties I encountered. To begin, I am trying to grab draft data by following this [blog post][1], but as you'll see, I quickly deviated because I ran into many errors and tried whatever I could to get around these issues. Part 1 of this project will be focused on getting the draft data from a single season, 1976 (the NBA merger season) with Part 2 focused on using the template here to create a loop to grab all draft data from 1976 to 2014 and combine them into a single large DataFrame.\n",

As I'll briefly discuss below, for some reason that did not work for me, instead, I continually got an empty list when I tried to grab the column headers and took an alternative route that may not be ideal for a data set with a vast number of column headers (so sooner or later I'll need to learn the first method). \n",

My next steps then are to drop those NaN filled columns and to create a list of accurate column headers to replace with the misaligned column headers.

    "## An Aside\n",
    "In trying to follow the same steps as the blog to replace column headers, I kept running into an error every time I tried to replace the column headers with those that I found using 'soup.finall' that I did not have a [1] list item. I ended up assigning the command to an object 'rows' and in looking at 'rows', as shown below, found it to be an empty list. I poked around quite a bit online and there are lots of people that seem to run into this issue, but for a wide variety of reasons. At this point I'm not sure if it's something to do with the versions of python and beautifulsoup that I'm running or something else. For the sake of simplicity I decided to simply use the method demonstrated above and created a list of column_names."

    "Creating this first DataFrame for one year of the draft took quite a bit more time than I would have thought (about a week working for a few hours in the evening when there was time.) Even with a blog post to follow, I ran into quite a few errors that required searching around the internet (mainly stackexchange) to find solutions. Python is trickier in its syntax than what I'm used to with Stata and whereas in Stata I would have solved some of these problems by building loops, Python has ready made commands to solve the problems while it's loops are still a little more difficult for me to implement. Now on to the second part of the blog post, creating a loop to grab all this draft data and putting it into a single DataFrame."
