# What's with all the flowers?

Every country has its mysteries. In traveling, I’ve nearly always found some local custom or practice that I don’t really understand. Not that I don’t understand the custom or practice, but more I don’t understand why it’s done or the motivation. Often the mysteries are easily solved by talking with a local and often the reason behind the practice or custom serves some rational purpose. Yet there some mysteries that persist, that despite hearing the reasoning, the practice or custom still seems irrational. Nairobi’s flower sellers fall into this latter category.

If you ever visit Nairobi and drive around the city, you’ll be greeted by narrow, winding one lane roads that are surrounded by walled in properties. While there are few sidewalks, on the busier, broader streets, there are often wide dirt shoulders that but up against these walls. And all along these shoulders you’ll find lines and lines of colorful plants. Flowers and shrubs in all shades of green and red, big and small flowers sprouting from tall, thin stalks and short, bushy shrubs can be found sprouting out of black bag containers. There are hundreds of them and they are found throughout the city.

This may not seem that puzzling, maybe Kenyans just really love plants, UNEP is based in Nairobi after all. Yet I’ve never seen anyone buy a plant. I don’t have a car, so I walk everywhere and in all my walking, not once did a car pull over to buy one of the thousands upon thousands of plants that can be found throughout the city. But this is just anecdotal evidence, and I’ve even spoken to house owners here who tell me that they have bought plants from these vendors. So maybe it’s just a small sample size issue.

But then we come to the other part of this mystery. In walking past all of these plants, I rarely see anyone actually there to sell the plants. Maybe this accounts for why I never see anyone buying the plants, there’s not a salesman to buy from. Yet the lack of a salesman doesn’t seem to lead to theft. The plants are left overnight, outside on the side of the road with zero oversight. The large walls surrounding all nearby properties and the often unlit streetlights presents any desirous plant owner an easy avenue to gather as many orange and red leaved shrubs as he likes with little chance of detection. So I’m confused.

##Kenyans have a lot of trust

This second issue, of leaving products on the side of the road with little oversight is not confined to just flowers. Driving out of the city, the roadside flower vendors are slow replaced by furniture makers. There are freshly made tables and beds and chairs stacked haphazardly on the side of the road. During the day, one can find shop owners working on new pieces of furniture, back behind the stacks of darkened wood. Yet at night, the shop closes, but the massive amount of furniture is left out, covered just with a tarp.

Clearly my own cultural practices play a role in not understanding. In the US, it’s nearly universal to lock your stuff up at night, to not leave valuables out where others could take them or where you’re not even there to sell them. But the combination of factors for the plant sellers is what truly puzzles me.

1. There is an abundance of plant sellers with nearly zero differentiation
1. The vendors are rarely present to actually sell the plants
1. There appears to be few buyers (most of the plants are perennials as well)
1. They leave the plants unwatched at night Given these factors, well I’m mystified why anyone is a plant seller. It’s a mystery that to me doesn’t appear to have a rational answer yet, though I admit I’ve yet to speak with a flower vendor.
