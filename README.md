# Blog_Content
In this repo I store all my python files that are eventually uploaded to my [blog][1]. Also
included is the data produced from my blog. Working on this repo provides me with experience
working on github and collaborating with my friends, CJ and Adam. 

## Current Project
### Text Analysis of Sportscasters Tweets
This project analyzes tweets from a sample of 49 sportscasters to analyze differences in the 
content between male and female sportscasters as well as differences in how men and women
sportscasters discuss men and women's sports. The project's files are loaded as 'sports_talk_twitter'.
The project uses a dataset of the last 3200 tweets from the 49 broadcasters that were pulled on
Nov. 7, 2016. The data is held in the twitter_soccer folder (originally I had just planned 
to look at soccer broadcasters). There are about 150K observations.

## Past Projects
### NBA draft analysis
My first project was an analysis of the
NBA draft. While many people have previously analyzed the correlation between draft position
and player quality, my hope is to (1) recreate some of this analysis to learn more about
Python and (2) to do some analysis on how well GMs/coaches have done at drafting since
the NBA merger in 1976. To put it lightly, lots of NBA draft analysis has been done ([ex1][3],
[ex2][4]), including a [study][2] by ESPN looking at the second question of the best GM drafters.
Despite not being original analysis, I'm choosing to start here because  this previous analysis 
provides a solid backdrop to check my results against as well as to potentially expand upon. 

#### Files
My NBA draft analysis files are broken into parts as I work through gathering, cleaning, 
and analyzing the data. For this I have been using Jupyter notebooks and I plug in lots of 
commentary to explain my process. I have not been uploading clean files because I want to 
show on my blog (and here) my learning process to hopefully help others as well as to track 
my development in writing cleaner, more efficient code and doing so faster. 
I also have a folder, NBA_Data, that contains all the CSV's I create during the project.
