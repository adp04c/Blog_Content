# About

This section of the blog is devoted to travel stories. As I mentioned in my 'About this blog' section, one of my passions is policy analysis and international development. This interest has led me to travel quite a bit and I am always seeking more. I am currently working with an international NGO, Namati, as a legal fellow in Nairobi, Kenya.While I am working abroad I will be updating this blog with random stories of my time in Kenya and posting about my work on land rights issues in Kenya.

# How I got where I am

My interest in international development and alleviating poverty led me to join the Peace Corps right after college. I couldn't have made a better decision and I look back on those two years as the most difficult and rewarding of my life. The time I spent in the Peace Corps inspired me to attend grad school for law and public policy with the hope of learning to use legal interventions to improve the lives of people in need. Public Policy school introduced me to econometrics and the rigorous evaluations commonly used by IPA, J-PAL and other organizations. This experience influenced my interests in law school, where I focused on researching how secure land rights can decrease poverty. In addition to my academic coursework, I spent summers working on land issues with leading land rights organizations such as Landesa and CLEC in Cambodia.

# Today

I am currently living abroad in Nairobi through funding from the Michigan Law Bates Fellowship. The Bates Fellowship is a wonderful opportunity for Michigan Law alums to work abroad following law school graduation. I was fortunate to receive funding for my proposal to work with Namati, another leading organization on land rights issues in developing countries, on their Community Land Project in Kenya. Since the end of March I have been carrying out legal research for Namati on Kenya's current land tenure system with an eye towards helping Namati's Kenyan partner organizations better secure rights to their land. After 3 months of desk research, I am now in Nairobi for five more months to continue my research by meeting with the community organizations, local lawyers, and legal scholars to discuss potential legal options for the communities.

# Moving forward

While I went to grad school with a goal of learning about land rights issues, I came away not only with a deeper understanding of the land rights field, but with a deep appreciation and love of data-driven analysis. Additionally, I have developed additional interests in domestic policy issues. For example, taking classes with Professor Dynarski at Michigan gave me an amazing introduction to education policy and really gave me the opportunity to look at a number of fields I had not considered prior to policy school (juvenile justice and immigration jump out). I am thrilled to be working on land rights issues now, and look forward to a career of examining and testing policies in many different sectors that can improve lives and alleviate poverty.
