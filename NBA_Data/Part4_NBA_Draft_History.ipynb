    "In grabbing the GM/coach info to attribute draft choices, basketball-reference appears again to be the place to go. [NBA.com][1] seemingly only has this info for the Lakers, though the way it's organized it would have been the easiest to exploit. As it is, grabbing the data from basketball-reference shouldn't be too difficult*, but it will require a lot more checking of the info to make sure it reflects the GM/Coach at the time of the draft and preseason rather than any mid-season changes.\n",

    "## Getting more complicated\n",
    "Writing up the proper code to get all the GM's assigned to the right year took a long time and involved quite a bit of trial and error. In this case, I wrote a bunch of code that worked for url, but then it hit snags in another because of date issues. So I adjusted the code to deal with those issues, but then it hit snags at the next url. Overall, I was going about finding solutions in a piecemeal fashion, rather than taking the time to look at the data to begin with and to craft a one size fits all solution. A classic example of how spending more time at the front-end to understand and anticipate issues would have saved me hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Now what is going on below\n",
    "As can be seen in the above DataFrame, I have a data set with the exact dates of a GM's tenure, as well as a start year column that I will use later to determine what year the GM started making draft choices. The problem I need to address is that some GM's might have never have actually drafted anyone. To deal with this, I need to create a starting cut date such that if a GM started after that date in a given year then he would not be credited with drafting the player drafted that year and a end cut off date such that if a GM didn't make it to the date in the given year he is not credited with drafting a player from that year. For example, in the above DataFrame, Ron Hrovat started on July 23, 1979, this was after the 1979 draft so he should not be credited with drafting Cleveland's pick in 1979. Hrovat was then fired/released on June 13, 1980, this was after the 1980 draft on June 10, so Hrovat should be credited with Cleveland's pick from 1980. \n",
    "In attempting to address this issue, I initially took the piecemeal approach and simply assumed that if a GM was the GM after July 1 of a given year then the GM didn't make the draft choice for that year and that if the GM was let go prior to June 8 of a given year then the GM didn't make the draft choice for that year as well. (I'm being a little generous to myself as I tried a number of other approaches and date combinations, including a method where I grouped years together if the draft was before June 12 and those after June 12 (this approach nearly works if only looking at drafts after 1976) in my piecemeal efforts that worked for some teams, but not all). Finally, after butting up against error after error in implementing the loop that went over all the teams, I got disgusted enough to do the following. The method given below is what I originally planned to do, but avoided doing since creating a dictionary of draft dates seemed (1) boring and (2) I thought I could be cool and find a way around this manual input. In the end, creating the dictionary would have been much faster, makes the logic easier to follow and allows me to stretch this analysis back to the start of the NBA if I wish. \n",
    "Creating these cut off columns was also a new experience for me. I am used to building loops that iterrate over cells in a column and row to create new columns or rows (this is usually what I do in Stata and I love the logic of loops). Though this can be done in Python, as I found out when trying to build a loop in Part 3, it can be much more complicated in Python since without a really solid foundation in how various operations work such as what a method, attribute, object, etc are I make a lot of time consuming mistakes. Without a stronger background in CS, I'm not quite sure of when a loop will work and when one won't, but the implementation below that applies a simple algorithm to make the new column and uses the very helpful .map runs faster and is cleaner to read.

To do this I create another column 'cut_year' that is just one year after the 'start_year', then, just as .map worked above, I populate a new column 'end_cut' with the draft date of the year following a GM's start."

    "## The 'Schaffel' Problem\n",
    "I chose to do the example url with Atlanta because they have GM's that illustrate the hardest problem to deal with. Looking at the dataset above, Lewis Schaffel was hired after July 1, 1979, and replaced on November 19, 1979. I needed accurate start and end cut off dates that captured that Schaffel was replaced before the 1980 draft. As such, I created accurate cut-off dates and the wrote two simple conditionals that dropped GM's that started after the date in the 'start_cut' column and were replaced before the date in the 'end_cut' column. Additionally, I dropped GM's whose 'Start' and 'End' dates were before the 'start_cut' date because these GM's represent those hired and fired in the same calendar year prior to the draft. \n",
    "## Using Datetime objects\n",
    "Python has datetime objects and a datetime library that make the conditional statements I use below very easy. It's pretty awesome that you can compare dates, add and subtract them to get the number of days, and perform other easy operations on dates in Python. Stata does not have such an easy object as far as I know."

    "2. Deal with pre-season draftee trades. Though there is a [site][1] that has draft day deals, it doesn't contain info on trades of draftees prior to the start of the season, but after the draft. I've seen at least some of this information on wikipedia, so I might have to grab it piece by piece from there. Luckily, there are not many of these trades, but some are quite significant (see Charlotte 1996). \n",
    "I plan to have the team that traded for the draftee reflected as the team that drafted the player since it seems to make sense that it was that team/GM/coach that saw the value (or not value) in the player. Furthermore, the way basketball-reference lays out the draft table is by the team who drafted the player, even if that player was drafted because of a trade with another team who requested that player be drafted and traded to them (see OKC and Domantas Sabonis 2016 where Orlando drafted Sabonis at the request of OKC with an eye towards an agreed upon trade).\n",
