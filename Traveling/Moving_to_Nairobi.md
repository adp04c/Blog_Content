#'Tis the season?

As a Peace Corps volunteer I remember being told that there are three general categories of development workers: missionaries, misfits, and mercenaries. I tend to think that Peace Corps volunteers, myself included, are likely to fall under the first two (you don't get rich on $200/month). I also don't believe that being a missionary necessarily means bringing a religious perspective, just that you may be drawn to the work out of some sense of morality. I describe these three categories because on this trip to Nairobi I think I finally saw just how many of these types there visiting or moving to Africa.

During my time as a volunteer I rarely encountered a development worker in Lesotho who was not a Peace Corps volunteer. Despite knowing people from back home who had done missionary trips to Africa, I rarely encountered any religious missionary for the 2+ years I lived abroad. Upon flying to Nairobi via Addis Ababa over the last 2 days I was struck by the sheer number of westerners in the airport.

Perhaps it's because of summer and students are out for internships, study abroad, and mission trips. Or perhaps Lesotho was an aberration, forgotten in the middle of South Africa with its tiny population and difficult terrain. Whatever the reason, Ethiopia and Kenya are currently are awash in foreign development workers.

## What's the point of this?

There isn't really a point to this post other than to express my own shock at the number of development workers coming to these countries. In Lesotho I was accustomed to never seeing a westerner I didn't know and I ignorantly assumed it would be similar for other African countries (outside of South Africa and Namibia).

It's interesting seeing the uniform for the vast majority of clearly missionary-driven development workers: coordinated shirts with associated churches and crosses. Coming from a conservative state I am used to seeing religion prominently displayed, but the number of crosses on shirts, and hanging from necklaces and bracelets was striking.

I wonder the extent to which Africans may assume that America is a united Christian country? In Lesotho I often faced many reductionist questions such as 'Have you ever met Rihanna?' or 'How did you get an African president?'. These questions seem to be grounded in Basotho assumptions about America based on their limited exposure to American culture. Basotho are very unlikely to meet a black American and there are few on TV or in movies such that there is an assumption that to be American is to be white. They also seem to assume that America, and many other countries are as small as Lesotho and thus it's very likely you might run into a star like Rihanna. I am not sure that this is where these questions derive from, but it seems reasonable. With that in mind, do many Africans also assume we are ubiquitously Christian?
